# LobeChat Integration Guide

This guide describes how to integrate the MiroThinker model with [LobeChat](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat), an open-source, modern LLM UI framework supporting tool usage (function calling).

## Before You Start

MiroThinker is a reasoning model. When generating responses, it first outputs its reasoning process inside `<think>...</think>` tags, then provides the final answer. For agentic tasks (multi-step tool use), the model performs better when it can see its previous reasoning in the conversation history.

However, LobeChat does not preserve reasoning content in conversation history. When sending messages back to the API, LobeChat strips the `<think>...</think>` content from previous assistant messages. This means the model cannot see its prior reasoning steps.

- For general chat: This works fine.
- For agentic workflows: Performance may be degraded since the model cannot reference its previous reasoning.

If you need full reasoning preservation for agentic use cases, consider modifying LobeChat's source code to return `reasoning_content` in conversation history.

## 1. Start the Inference Service

First, launch the MiroThinker model using vLLM with the OpenAI-compatible API adapter. We use vLLM because it supports loading custom tool parsers from external Python files, while SGLang does not. Ensure you include the tool parser plugin.

```bash
# Configuration
PORT=61002
MODEL_PATH=miromind-ai/MiroThinker-v1.5-30B

# Start vLLM server
vllm serve $MODEL_PATH \
    --served-model-name mirothinker \
    --port $PORT \
    --trust-remote-code \
    --chat-template chat_template.jinja \
    --tool-parser-plugin MiroThinkerToolParser.py \
    --tool-call-parser mirothinker \
    --enable-auto-tool-choice
```

## 2. Configure LobeChat

You can use either the self-hosted version or the [web application](https://lobechat.com/chat).

### Step 1: Access Settings

Navigate to **Settings** -> **AI Service Provider** to add a custom AI service provider.

### Step 2: Add Custom AI Provider

Click the `+` button to add a new provider and configure it as follows:

![Add AI Provider](img/AI-provider.png)

| Field | Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Provider ID** | `miromind` | Or any identifier you prefer. |
| **Request Format** | `OPENAI` |  |
| **API Key** | `your-api-key` | Use any string if auth is disabled. |
| **API Proxy Address** | `http://localhost:61002/v1` | Replace with your actual service address. |

### Step 3: Configure the Model

After adding the provider, add the models you deploy to the service provider's model list.:

1. Add a new model with the ID `mirothinker` (must match `--served-model-name`).
1. **Crucial**: Enable the **Function Calling** capability toggle.
1. Click "Check" to verify connectivity.

## 3. Usage Demo

Once configured, you can use MiroThinker in LobeChat with full tool-calling capabilities.
