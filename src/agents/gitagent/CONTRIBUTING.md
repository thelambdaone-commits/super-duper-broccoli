## Guidelines

- **TypeScript** — all code is written in strict TypeScript
- **ESM** — the project uses ES modules (`"type": "module"`)
- **Keep it simple** — avoid over-engineering; minimal dependencies
- **Test your changes** — add or update tests in `test/` when applicable
- **One concern per PR** — keep pull requests focused and reviewable

## Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

- `Add voice mode with OpenAI Realtime adapter`
- `Fix memory tool path resolution on Windows`
- `Update SDK query to support abort signals`

## Reporting Issues

- Search existing issues before opening a new one
- Include reproduction steps, expected vs actual behavior, and your environment (Node version, OS)
