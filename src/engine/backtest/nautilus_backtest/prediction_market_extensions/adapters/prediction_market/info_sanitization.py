"""Strip resolution-revealing fields from instrument metadata.

Loaders persist whatever the venue API returns into `BinaryOption.info`. For
already-resolved markets that payload includes the answer (Kalshi `result`,
Polymarket per-token `winner`, settlement values, UMA resolution status, etc.).
A backtest strategy can read `self.cache.instrument(...).info` from `on_start`,
which is a look-ahead vector that silently inflates results.

This module redacts those fields before the instrument is constructed. The
resolution slice is returned separately so the loader can still surface a
realized outcome for post-hoc analytics (Brier scores, settlement PnL).
