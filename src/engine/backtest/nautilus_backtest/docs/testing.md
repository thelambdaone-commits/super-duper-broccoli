# Testing

## Standard Repo Gate

Run these before cutting a commit intended for the PR:

```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run pytest tests/ -q
```

Equivalent Make targets:

```bash
make check
make test
```

## Useful Smoke Checks

Public Python runner smoke checks:

```bash
uv run python backtests/polymarket_book_ema_crossover.py
uv run python backtests/polymarket_book_ema_optimizer.py
uv run python backtests/polymarket_book_joint_portfolio_runner.py
uv run python backtests/polymarket_telonex_book_joint_portfolio_runner.py
```

All public Python runners:

```bash
uv run python scripts/run_all_backtests.py
```

Menu path:

```bash
make backtest
```

Sandbox menu path:

```bash
make sandbox
```

`make sandbox` should discover local files under `live/`. The framework ships
shared helpers plus any public-safe runner scaffolds, while model artifacts and
local runtime files stay ignored under `live/`.

Focused sandbox tests:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_live_sandbox.py tests/test_main.py -q
```

These tests cover the sandbox menu mode, BTC 5m market helper behavior, live
BTC feature buffering, and Nautilus sandbox config construction without making
live network calls. Public live tests should cover helper behavior and runner
config shape, not private strategy internals or ignored model artifacts. Private
strategy tests can be skipped when the ignored local strategy module is absent.

The runner smokes cover:

- PMXT L2 book replay from filtered cache, local raw mirror, and archive
  fallback.
- Telonex L2 full-book replay from local mirror, API-day cache, and API
  fallback when configured.
- Real trade-tick integration for execution.
- `BookType.L2_MBP`, `liquidity_consumption=True`, `trade_execution=True`, and
  optional `queue_position=True`.
- Summary report generation without per-market HTML files.

PMXT public runners pin `local:/Volumes/storage/pmxt_data` first, then
`archive:r2v2.pmxt.dev` and `archive:r2.pmxt.dev`. The Telonex joint runner
pins `api:${TELONEX_API_KEY}` first, then
`local:/Volumes/storage/telonex_data` as the local mirror fallback.

Coverage is mixed by design:

- Fast unit tests for strategies, loaders, cache, and source selection.
- Focused tests for replay adapter architecture and execution wiring.
- Smoke tests for direct backtest entrypoints.
- Docs build validation for Markdown, MkDocs config, and theme changes.

If you are validating runner realism changes, include focused tests plus at
least one PMXT runner and one Telonex runner. If the user asks whether
"everything works" or asks for end-to-end validation, run every public Python
entrypoint under `backtests/` and do not claim success until each returns 0.

## Docs Validation

When docs, README navigation, MkDocs config, theme CSS, code-fence behavior, or
docs assets change, run:

```bash
uv run mkdocs build --strict
```
